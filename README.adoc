image::https://i.postimg.cc/rwMKQQFJ/tetris-screenshot.png[]

Builds and runs on MacOS and Web Assembly, but with a bit of effort should run elsewhere too.

== Build it...
Install the Xcode command line tools
[source,bash]
xcode-select --install

Install
https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html[emscripten].

Install SDL2 via Homebrew and run make
[source,bash]
----
$ brew install sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_ttf
$ make
----

Run the native build with `./build/tetris` or the Web Assembly build using the `index.html` file through a web server. E.g.
[source,bash]
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
